Intro feedback: 
	why is it an important problem to solve (to actually improve the real life robotic implementations factories or other automations) 
	add related work kicker or simpler RL for shooting we tackle the harder problems - discreet actions seem to work well 
	add small summary of conclusions discreet action actually perform better dccs actually good middle ground. 






Good ones:
FP_DCCM_1.5
FP_DCCS_1.6









rest:
robustness: noise
learnability: training, reaction to different enemies
reactiveness: performance vs enemies

cont: just shoot hope it gets there, (not consistatly reacting to other types of players)
	 learned to mainly middle pass

DCCM: slow "just shoot" wall pass slowest
DCCM-8999: a bit weird just use above

DCCS-999151: slow but reacts mainly just shoot seems to try both corner and mid pass
DCCS-1999603: better one, waits for agent to move in static cases 2nd slowest. kinda just corner pass shoot and hope

Descreet: fast and both mid and corner pass. waits for agent to get out of the way in static. kinda jurky moves waits good rythimic "collect back is fun"
